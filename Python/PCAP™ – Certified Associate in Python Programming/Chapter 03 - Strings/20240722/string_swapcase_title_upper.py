# The swapcase() method
# The swapcase() method makes a new string by swapping the case of all letters within the source string: lower-case characters become upper-case, and vice versa.
# All other characters remain untouched.

# Ex.
# i KNOW THAT i KNOW NOTHING.

# Demonstrating the swapcase() method:
print("I know that I know nothing.".swapcase())
print("="*100)

# The title() method
# The title() method performs a somewhat similar function - it changes every word's first letter to upper-case, turning all other ones to lower-case.

# Ex.
# I Know That I Know Nothing. Part 1.

# Demonstrating the title() method:
print("I know that I know nothing. Part 1.".title())
print("="*100)

# The upper() method
# Last but not least, the upper() method makes a copy of the source string, replaces all lower-case letters with their upper-case counterparts, and returns the string as the result.

# Ex.
# I KNOW THAT I KNOW NOTHING. PART 2.

# Demonstrating the upper() method:
print("I know that I know nothing. Part 2.".upper())
